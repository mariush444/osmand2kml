# osmand2kml
Osmand gpx file to KML conversion with icons (from osmand icons to newer google icons style).

Generally osmand gpx file can be import to gMaps but only one standard icon is used.

The converter will try to find the best google icon similar to Osmand icon.

Proposition of mapping between gmap and osmand icons can be find in <a href="https://github.com/mariush444/gmapIcons2osmand/blob/main/icons-gmap-osmand.pdf"> icons-gmap-osmand.pdf </a>

PS</br>
Python 3 is needed.</br>
There are some icons for my needs only implemented for this moment.</br>
Not implemented icons are presented as x-cross icon in gMaps to easier find what to do.</br>
Let me know if you have suggestions and don't know how to do it.</br>
